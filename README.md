# numerical_computing
This is a simple library for numerical computing. 
The main module is the linear_algebra_2 module , which is used in other modules as well.In it , the user can find 3 main classes , the matrix , the vector and the complex number.
The module heavily relies on those to perform manipulations and operations. It is equipped with most basic linear algebra tools , such as a linear system solver and matrix inversion , but it also includes special function to handle complex numbers and their matrices.Finally , in this module there is a robust Discrete Fourier Transform algorithm, which however is slower than the numpy counterpart and should only be used for demonstration.

The second ''main module'' is analysis. In it , the user can find basic numerical analysis tools , such as derivatives , integrals and a class that handles vector fields. In the analysis module a newton-raphson algorithm is also included.

The stats module contains some basic linear regression , least sqaures fit and perceptron algorithms.

The ode modules contains two Runge-Kutta integrators for numerically approximating the solutions of differential equations.

Finally the signal processing module has a ready-to-use , numpy based algorithm process signals (using the Fast Fourier Transform).

Please report any bugs and feel free to fork the code.

Thank you
